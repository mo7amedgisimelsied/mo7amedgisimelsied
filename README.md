# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mohamed Gisimelsied

A Software Development student at IU University and a graphic designer. I have a passion for creating and designing web applications, with a strong focus on frontend development and UI/UX design. I also enjoy creating content on YouTube for fun.

Currently, I am taking a full stack development path, starting with frontend technologies and gradually expanding to backend development. Some of the technologies I am focusing on include javaScript, React.js, CSS, Bootstrap, tailwind, MySQL, Java Spring Boot, and unit testing frameworks.

I am actively looking for internship opportunities to gain practical experience and contribute to exciting projects.
